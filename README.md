# CarDriver
This is a side project that I worked on the summer before my junior year at college. The goal for the game was for it to mimic the game "Smashy Road". The mechanics I was able to implement are standard collisions between the player and other environmental objects. The screen is centered on the player which always is in the center of the screen. In addition, projectiles were recently added and standard collisions were setup between the environment and the player. Future goals are to add moveable "police" cars which chase the player and shoot "projectiles". Updating the environment to include streets and biomes would be part of the next stage as well.
